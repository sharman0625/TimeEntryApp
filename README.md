# TimeEntryApp
A time-entry platform to maintain the time logs of tasks

This is a time log project which lets user add project and its respective tasks.
User can add start and end time of task along with its title.
User can choose to assign a task to a particular project.

In this project I have used ‘django.contrib.auth’ for authentication. 
We can also use django-allauth which can support 3rd party authentications.

I have used django-environ to utilize environment variables

Live Project is hosted on Heroku
